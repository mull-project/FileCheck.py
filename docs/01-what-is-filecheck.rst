What is FileCheck.py
====================

**FileCheck.py** is a Python port of **LLVM's FileCheck**, "flexible
pattern matching file verifier" [1_].

LLVM's FileCheck is a command-line tool written in C++ which
is developed and maintained as part of LLVM source code [2_].

FileCheck is most often used in a combination with another tool called **LIT
(LLVM Integrated Tester)** [3_]. LIT is a test runner that runs commands
from the test files, FileCheck is used as a test matcher tool that checks output
of the commands run by LIT.

2024-07-10 STATUS UPDATE - PROJECT DISCONTINUED
-----------------------------------------------

The project has been discontinued in favor of another project: `antonlydike/filecheck <https://github.com/AntonLydike/filecheck>`_, where the developers are aiming to achieve greater compatibility with the upstream LLVM FileCheck and add more features that this project was lacking.

The filecheck PyPI package has also been transferred to the owner of antonlydike/filecheck.

Why Python port?
----------------

There are software projects that would benefit from having a suite of LIT-based
integration tests. Mull mutation testing system is one example [4_].

The problem is that you have to build FileCheck from LLVM sources which is not a trivial task for 1) people who are not familiar with the LLVM infrastructure and
2) Python-based projects which would prefer to not depend on anything C or
C++-related including building dependencies from LLVM sources.

The option of having pre-compiled binaries is a workaround, but it is not always
possible to keep third-party binary artifacts in source code
(see
https://github.com/doorstop-dev/doorstop/pull/431#issuecomment-549237579).

**Note:** FileCheck.py is not intended to be a replacement for LLVM's FileCheck
in any way. See :ref:`roadmap`.

What's next?
------------

If you are new to FileCheck and integration testing using LIT, we recommend you
to read the tutorials: :doc:`03-tutorial-hello-world` and
:doc:`04-tutorial-lit-and-filecheck`.

If you know how FileCheck and LIT work, you can check out the status of the port
on the :ref:`roadmap` page.
