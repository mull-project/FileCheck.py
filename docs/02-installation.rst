2024-07-10 STATUS UPDATE - PROJECT DISCONTINUED
-----------------------------------------------

The project has been discontinued in favor of another project: `antonlydike/filecheck <https://github.com/AntonLydike/filecheck>`_, where the developers are aiming to achieve greater compatibility with the upstream LLVM FileCheck and add more features that this project was lacking.

The filecheck PyPI package has also been transferred to the owner of antonlydike/filecheck.
