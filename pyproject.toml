# FIXME: Problems with wrapt when running on CI with Python 3.11.
# This fix seems to work, however there is another issue with pyinvoke.
# waiting until the 3.11 issues are fixed with invoke:
# https://github.com/pyinvoke/invoke/issues/833
# Adding this dependency only to fix CI building on 3.11.
# At some point, check again if this issue still exists.
